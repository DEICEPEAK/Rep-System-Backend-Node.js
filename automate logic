I am a data scientist working in bank

Different department do request for same data in google sheet every start of the week: the loan collection department always ask for expected loan users that will be due in the current ween which i have to run the query below to answer their requets




SELECT
  l.user_id,
  u.first_name,
  u.last_name,
  u.phone_number,
  u.email,
  l.total_oustanding_amount,
  l.loan_end_date
FROM aella_edw.rds_aella_loan_performance l
JOIN aella_edw.rds_aella_user_enrollment u
ON l.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE DATE(l.loan_end_date) BETWEEN '2025-08-25' AND '2025-08-31'
AND l.total_oustanding_amount > 0

then i send the google sheet to them 


below used to track expected repayment for the current week
------------------------------------EXPECTED REPAYMENT FROM WEEKLY REPAYMENT LOANs
SELECT 
  m.user_id, 
  m.first_name, 
  m.last_name, 
  m.email, 
  m.phone_number, 
  l.loan_status, 
  l.total_oustanding_amount to_repay, 
  l.total_amount_repaid,  
  l.loan_start_date, 
  l.loan_end_date
FROM aella_edw.rds_aella_loan_performance l
JOIN aella-money-location-service.aellalive_Mpoko.loans m
ON l.loan_id = m.id
WHERE m.repayment_mode = "WEEKLY"
AND DATE(m.next_due_date) BETWEEN '2025-08-25' AND '2025-08-31'




and also the below query to help track recovered amount from expected
WITH loans AS
(SELECT
  l.loan_id
FROM aella_edw.rds_aella_loan_performance l
JOIN aella-money-location-service.aellalive_Mpoko.loans m
ON l.loan_id = m.id
WHERE l.loan_status = 'Default'
AND m.repayment_mode = "WEEKLY"
),

paid AS
(SELECT
r.repayment_amount,
r.loan_id
FROM aella_edw.rds_aella_loan_repayments r
WHERE DATE(r.repayment_date) BETWEEN '2025-08-25' AND '2025-08-31')

SELECT 
  SUM(repayment_amount) AS total_recovered,
  COUNT(DISTINCT paid.loan_id) AS users_recovered_from
FROM paid JOIN loans ON paid.loan_id = loans.loan_id;




The issue is this, all these king=d of task are recurring task that should be automated, the sheet to be automatical generated for them so they can contact the loan users, the  other kpis should be automated to see refreshed data at every time  and also seeing the previous week kpi  (in tabular form, not % difference/delta) to help keep tracking data. Now how do we automate this?



Highlight and discuss options only(no implementation yet)
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 54s

Awesome problem to automate, David. Below are solid options—from “fast + lightweight” to “robust + governed”—so you can pick what fits your team, data volumes, and controls. I’ll focus on what each option solves, how it’d work, pros/cons, and when to choose it. (No implementation yet, per your ask.)

Option 1 — Google Sheets + Apps Script (Scheduled pulls from BigQuery)

What it does: A single Google Sheet per audience auto-refreshes every Monday (Africa/Lagos), populating:

“Current Week Due Loans”

“Expected Weekly Repayments”

“Recovered This Week”

“Previous Week KPIs” (tabular, not deltas)

How it works: Apps Script runs your SQL (parameterized week), truncates/overwrites tabs, writes results, stamps “Last refresh,” and notifies stakeholders.

Pros

Fastest to ship. Lives right where the teams already work.

Zero extra infra; native triggers and sharing.

Easy to give them a “Refresh now” button.

Cons

Sheets size/quotas (10M cells, API limits).

Limited testing/versioning; governance is weaker.

Can get slow if results are large.

Choose if: Volumes are moderate; you want minimal infra and you must deliver data in Sheets.

Option 2 — BigQuery Scheduled Queries + Connected Sheets

What it does: Centralize logic in BigQuery; schedule daily/weekly queries to materialize three canonical tables/views:

loans_due_current_week

expected_repayments_weekly

recovered_weekly
Plus a weekly snapshot table to power “Previous Week KPIs.”

How it works:

BigQuery scheduled queries compute week_start/week_end (WAT) and write to partitioned tables.

Stakeholders use a Google Sheet connected to BigQuery (Connected Sheets) with protected views and simple filters.

Refresh on open or scheduled.

Pros

Governance & performance: compute once; consume many times.

Handles larger data than raw Sheets.

One source of truth; less duplication and fewer manual errors.

Cons

Requires Connected Sheets access/licensing.

Users still in Sheets, but refresh cadence is tied to BigQuery job timing.

Choose if: You want a governed, scalable “Sheet experience” with BigQuery doing the heavy lifting.

Option 3 — Orchestrated Pipeline (Cloud Composer/Airflow or Cloud Run + Cloud Scheduler)

What it does: A weekly DAG (and an optional daily) runs:

Build curated/week-partitioned tables (current & previous week).

Export results into Google Sheets (or CSVs in Drive).

Apply formatting, protect ranges, stamp freshness.

Notify teams (email/Chat/Slack) with links.

Pros

Most control: retries, SLAs, alerting, backfills, lineage.

Easy to add data-quality checks and branching logic (e.g., “if recovery < threshold, ping collections lead”).

Versioned code in Git; infra-as-code.

Cons

More engineering setup and maintenance.

Overkill for lightweight needs.

Choose if: Cross-team reuse and reliability matter; you need robust monitoring, testing, and extensibility.

Option 4 — dbt (Core or Cloud) + BigQuery + Sheets/Exports

What it does: Put all logic in dbt models:

Current-week and previous-week models (incremental/partitioned)

Tests (e.g., not null on IDs, referential integrity), docs, lineage

Then:

dbt job on a schedule → BigQuery tables → surface via Connected Sheets or export to Sheets/CSV.

Pros

Strong modeling, tests, and documentation.

Easy to evolve logic once, reuse everywhere (Sheets, dashboards, APIs).

Great for analytics engineering workflow.

Cons

Requires dbt skills and CI/CD setup.

Still need an export layer if teams insist on Sheets files.

Choose if: You want durable, testable analytics code and a clean semantic layer.

Option 5 — Looker Studio/Looker dashboard + Scheduled Delivery

What it does: Build a dashboard with three tables + a “Previous Week KPIs” table. Schedule a weekly email delivery (PDF/CSV) to each department and/or pin the live dashboard.

Pros

Zero manual distribution; always-on single link.

Handles larger volumes than Sheets, with row-level security if needed.

Version-less for consumers; fewer copies of truth.

Cons

Not a Google Sheet; some teams insist on Sheets for dialing customers.

“Export to Google Sheets” is not the native path—more CSV/Excel/PDF.

Choose if: You can shift stakeholders from Sheets to a dashboard or accept scheduled CSV exports.

Option 6 — GCS Exports + Sheet Loader (Hybrid)

What it does: BigQuery jobs write weekly CSVs to Cloud Storage (current & previous week). An Apps Script (or small Cloud Run job) ingests those CSVs into a master Google Sheet, one tab per artifact.

Pros

Durable archive of weekly snapshots in GCS.

Sheet gets updated from canonical files; simple swap if schema changes.

Cons

Two-step plumbing (export + import).

Some complexity vs. Option 2.

Choose if: You want both archival files and a live Sheet target.

Option 7 — Self-Service Portal (AppSheet or a small web app)

What it does: Front-end with date pickers (“Current week,” “Previous week,” custom ranges). Users export a Sheet/CSV on demand; weekly scheduled runs still precompute tables for speed.

Pros

Reduces ad-hoc requests and DMs.

Central access governance and auditing.

Cons

Requires building/maintaining a small app.

Change management for users.

Choose if: Multiple departments query variations frequently and you want to end bespoke requests.

Cross-cutting best practices (whichever option you pick)

Date logic (Africa/Lagos): Use CURRENT_DATE('Africa/Lagos'), DATE_TRUNC(..., WEEK(MONDAY)) for week_start, and week_start + 6 for week_end. Keeps “current week” and “previous week” consistent across artifacts.

Snapshots for “Previous Week KPIs”: Don’t recompute-from-scratch only—persist weekly snapshots (partition by week_start) so historicals don’t drift.

Single source of truth: Encapsulate the three metrics in BigQuery views/models; every downstream (Sheets, dashboards, emails) consumes those.

PII governance: Restrict phone/email to only the collections Sheet; use views with column masking/row-level security for others.

Data quality & alerts: Add tests (nulls, duplicates, volume thresholds, late/missing data). Alert if row count deviates or refresh fails.

Freshness stamp: Always show “Data as of {timestamp WAT}” in the Sheet/tab header.

Access control: Share to Google Groups, not individuals. Protect ranges; make tabs read-only for most users.

Performance & quotas: Keep Sheet tabs <100k rows if possible; archive older weeks to a separate “History” Sheet or just leave history in BigQuery.

Quick decision guide

Need it fast, minimal infra, teams must work in Sheets: Option 1

Governed + scalable “Sheet experience” with BigQuery doing the work: Option 2

Enterprise-grade orchestration, testing, and alerting: Option 3 (possibly with Option 4 dbt inside)

Willing to move to dashboards and scheduled deliveries: Option 5

Want durable weekly files + a live Sheet: Option 6

Frequent ad-hoc variants; reduce inbound requests: Option 7

If you want, I can recommend a target architecture tailored to your current stack (e.g., BigQuery + dbt + Connected Sheets), including the exact entities to materialize and the weekly schedule—still no implementation, just the blueprint.

kindly zoom in option 1 and 2 more for better understanding
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 43s

got it—let’s zoom in on Option 1 (Sheets + Apps Script) and Option 2 (BigQuery Scheduled + Connected Sheets). I’ll keep this to architecture, roles, and operating model—no implementation code.

Option 1 — Google Sheets + Apps Script (scheduled pulls from BigQuery)
What this looks like to users

One shared Google Sheet with 4 tabs:

Current Week — Loans Due

Current Week — Expected Weekly Repayments

Current Week — Recovered (Weekly Loans)

Previous Weeks — KPI Table (one row per week; not % deltas)

“Last refreshed (WAT): 2025-08-26 06:05”

Filters/frozen headers, protected ranges; collections team can filter, copy/paste phone numbers, etc.

Data flow (at a glance)

Apps Script time trigger (e.g., Mondays 06:00 Africa/Lagos) → compute week_start/week_end → run 3 queries in BigQuery → write results to the 3 “current week” tabs → append/update “previous weeks KPI” tab → send brief email/Chat notification with row counts + links.

Date logic (central rule so no hardcoding)

week_start = DATE_TRUNC(CURRENT_DATE('Africa/Lagos'), WEEK(MONDAY))

week_end = week_start + 6

Allow an override in a small “Config” sheet (e.g., week_offset = -1 for backfills/testing).

What lives where

Google Sheet: “Data” tabs + a “Config” tab (week override, recipients, alert thresholds).

Apps Script project: a small orchestrator:

function runAll():

compute week bounds

run query A/B/C (BigQuery Advanced Service)

write to ranges in tabs (batch writes)

rebuild “Previous Weeks KPI” (either append this week, or fully refresh from a weekly summary query)

format + protect ranges

notify on success/failure

Governance & access

Sheet stored in a Shared Drive.

Share to Google Groups, not individuals.

Protect PII: if other teams view the file, keep phone/email only on the collections tab; hide or protect as needed.

Monitoring & resilience

Email/Chat summary: row counts per tab, min/max dates, timestamp, and “data as of” job time.

Failure path: catch errors → send alert → leave last successful data intact (so teams always have something).

Volume guardrails: try to keep each tab ≤ 100k rows; archive older detail in BigQuery rather than Sheets.

Strengths / tradeoffs

Strengths: fastest path; zero new infra; user experience identical to today (just automated).

Tradeoffs: Apps Script & Sheets quotas/latency; limited testing/versioning; less suitable for very large result sets or many consumers.

When this is a great fit

Collections must operate in Sheet; volumes are moderate; speed-to-value matters more than enterprise bells & whistles.

Option 2 — BigQuery Scheduled Queries + Connected Sheets (governed “compute once, share many”)
What this looks like to users

Same Google Sheet feel, but Connected Sheets pulls directly from BigQuery tables/views:

Tab 1: loans_due_current_week (view/table)

Tab 2: expected_repayments_weekly

Tab 3: recovered_weekly

Tab 4: kpi_weekly_snapshot (one row per week)

Refresh is instant for users (query runs in BigQuery under the hood), or auto-refresh on open/schedule.

Semantic layer (your single source of truth)

Create one dataset (e.g., aella_analytics) to house curated artifacts:

Views (always-current logic)

v_loans_due_current_week

v_expected_repayments_weekly

v_recovered_current_week

These encapsulate joins/filters and always compute the current week via CURRENT_DATE('Africa/Lagos').

Snapshot / fact table (for history)

fact_kpi_weekly_snapshot with columns like:

week_start, week_end

loans_due_count, loans_due_outstanding_sum

expected_weekly_count, expected_weekly_amount_sum

recovered_amount, users_recovered_from

last_refreshed_at
Partitioned by week_start (DATE). This powers the “Previous Weeks — KPI Table” without recomputation drift.

Orchestration (lightweight, fully in BigQuery)

Scheduled Query #1 (daily or Mon 05:30 WAT): refresh fact_kpi_weekly_snapshot (insert/update the row for the current week; keep history).

Scheduled Query #2 (optional daily): materialize denormalized tables backing the Connected Sheets tabs (if you prefer tables over views for performance/cache).

Optionally enable email alerts on failed scheduled queries.

Connected Sheets setup

In Google Sheets: Data → Connect to BigQuery → pick each view/table → create a tab per artifact.

Turn on Auto Refresh (e.g., on open or hourly) and display “Data as of” using a small metadata query (e.g., SELECT MAX(last_refreshed_at) from the snapshot).

Governance & security

Store curated objects in a separate dataset (aella_analytics) with:

Row-level security if different departments should see different slices.

Column-level security (mask PII for non-collections audiences).

Access granted to Groups; service accounts run the scheduled queries.

Monitoring & quality

Add data-quality checks to scheduled jobs (e.g., assert row count > 0; amounts non-negative). On failure, alert and do not overwrite.

Keep job history + Cloud Monitoring alerts to the analytics inbox/Chat space.

Strengths / tradeoffs

Strengths: scalable; governed; one computation feeds many consumers; better performance; history is durable; low friction for end users.

Tradeoffs: requires Connected Sheets access; slightly more upfront modeling (views + snapshot table); users must learn “Refresh” vs. static values if you don’t auto-refresh.

When this is a great fit

Multiple teams consume the same logic; volumes are larger; you want repeatable, governed analytics with minimal Sheet fragility.

Side-by-side: what changes for your three recurring asks



| Need                                  | Option 1 (Apps Script → Sheet)                               | Option 2 (BQ + Connected Sheets)                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Loans due this week**               | Script runs your query, writes rows to “Loans Due” tab.      | `v_loans_due_current_week` view; Sheet reads live via Connected Sheets.        |
| **Expected repayment (WEEKLY)**       | Script runs query using `next_due_date` filter; writes rows. | `v_expected_repayments_weekly` view; same filter in view; live pull.           |
| **Recovered this week (sum + count)** | Script executes CTE query; writes aggregate table.           | `v_recovered_current_week` view or a small table with computed metrics.        |
| **Previous week KPIs (tabular)**      | Script appends/refreshes a KPI tab weekly.                   | `fact_kpi_weekly_snapshot` holds all weeks; Sheet just displays it.            |
| **Freshness**                         | Timestamp cell set by script.                                | `last_refreshed_at` + job timestamp; Connected Sheets shows latest on refresh. |
| **Change management**                 | Edit script & redeploy; possible Sheet copies.               | Edit view SQL once; all Sheets update on next refresh.                         |
| **Scalability**                       | Limited by Sheet size & Apps Script quotas.                  | Scales with BigQuery; Sheets acts as a thin viewer.                            |




Common pitfalls to avoid (both options)

Timezone drift: always compute weeks in 'Africa/Lagos'. Do not mix UTC for week boundaries.

Double counting: de-dup repayments (idempotent logic) if late-arriving records exist.

Moving targets for history: use weekly snapshots for KPIs so last week’s numbers don’t silently change.

PII sprawl: keep phone/email only where operationally needed; mask elsewhere.

Sheet bloat: keep detailed history in BigQuery; show only the current week in operational tabs and a compact weekly KPI table for history.

How I’d choose between them for your bank

If the collections team must work inside a Sheet and you want a quick win, start with Option 1. It gets you to “no more manual runs” fast.

If multiple departments consume this and you want one source of truth with auditability and history baked in, go straight to Option 2 (or migrate to it after an Option-1 pilot).

If you want, I can draft a blueprint for each (entities, schedules, tabs, access model, and testing plan) so you can socialize the approach with stakeholders—still no code, just the architecture pack.
